    "### Coronavirus has been the most spoken topic of 2020 so far. The first news of its outbreak came out by the end of January and then many cases were registered all over the world. That was the start of the global pandemic. Many countries went in lockdown, shops were closed, only supermarket, pharmacies and hospital were open. All over the world was possible to notice people disappointment and anger towards this virus. Many times we have heard that this virus was God's punishment for all the sins committed by mankind, others instead affirmed that God had nothing to do with the virus, but that He was going to use it for a greater purpose. Our goal is to analyze the religious sentiment of people during the spreading of the virus and understand which of the two classes is predominant. Did faith increase during this period? Or people changed their mind about God? "

    "###### When the news of the virus came out people started posting about God, but then by the end of the first month it significantly dropped, this was probably due to the fact that it was not taken seriously, mostly in the United States. But then in March it became a reality for almost all the world so we see an increase during the month of March and for the month of April there was an almost stationary trend. It is how the positve sentiment outperforms the negative one for all the days. Usually people believe that God punishes people for their mistakes, but in this case we have seen how people actually turn to God when the times were rough and hopeless."
